PyTorch GPU Project
This project utilizes PyTorch with GPU support to perform computations on the NVIDIA CUDA platform. This README provides steps to set up the prerequisites, run the test script for local files, and execute the scraper.

Prerequisites
1. NVIDIA Software
Ensure you have the following NVIDIA software installed:

CUDA Toolkit 12.3: Required for GPU support. If not already installed, download it from the official NVIDIA website.
2. PyTorch with GPU Support
Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.3 support:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu123/torch_stable.html
Running the Test Script for Local Files
Navigate to the directory containing the test script:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/directory
Execute the test script:
bash
Copy code
python test_script.py
Running the Scraper
Navigate to the directory containing the scraper script:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/scraper_directory
Execute the scraper script:
bash
Copy code
python scraper_script.py
Additional Notes
Ensure your data and model fit in GPU memory. If you encounter memory issues, consider techniques like gradient accumulation or model checkpointing.
Always monitor GPU usage and temperature to ensure safe and optimal operation.
